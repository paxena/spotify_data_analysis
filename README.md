# spotify_data_analysis
Project Overview :- 

This project focuses on exploring the relationship between the audio features of songs and the sentiment of their lyrics using Spotify's dataset. The primary objective is to determine how audio features, such as tempo, energy, and danceability, correlate with the positivity or negativity of a song's lyrics. To achieve this, sentiment analysis is applied to the song lyrics, and supervised machine learning models are used to predict sentiment based on the audio features.
